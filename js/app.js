//Problem solving with Functions

//1. Verbal questions
//1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?
//A perameter is the variable you put between the () within a function.
//ex. (num, str, arr)
//An argument is the value you put in the () when you call a function.
//ex. function(123); 

//2. Within a function, what is the difference between return and 
//console.log?
//Return actually outputs the value to the interface.
//console.log is a way to check and debug code only seen by programmers.

//3. What are the implications of the ability of a function to 
//return a value?
//return actually outputs the value so it can be stored as a variable 
//and used later.
